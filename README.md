# 2048 Game

This project is a classic implementation of the **2048 game**, built with a focus on smooth user experience.

The primary purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience in working with **CSS animations**.

## Gameplay

### Objective
Combine tiles with the same number to create higher-value tiles. There are no limits â€” reach as high as you can!ðŸš€

### Rules
- **Move Tiles:** Use the arrow keys to slide all tiles in one direction: Up, Down, Left, or Right.
- **Merge Tiles:** When two tiles with the same number collide during a move, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.
- **Score Points:** Each merge adds the value of the new tile to your score.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if there are no more valid moves (no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same number).
